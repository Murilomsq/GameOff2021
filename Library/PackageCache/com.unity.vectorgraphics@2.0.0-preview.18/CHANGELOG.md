## [2.0.0-preview.2] - 2019-06-18

### Changes

There are some breaking changes when going from `1.0.0-preview` to `2.0.0-preview`:

* The deprecated API have been removed.  Most notably, the removal of the `IDrawable` interface.
* The texture atlas layout for the gradient settings was changed.  It now stores gradient settings in the first 3 columns of the atlas instead of the first row.  This allows for a more efficient atlas packing.  If you made a variant of the `Unlit/VectorGradient` shader, you may have to update it.
* The `SVGImporter` will now ignore the root `viewBox` attribute by default.  Use the "Only Apply Root ViewBox" viewport option to bring back the old behavior.

### Fixes

* Fixed flipYAxis in FillMesh API
